BTS Framework
=============

An extension to Zend Framework to make it a little bit more useful. There may be better ways of doing things that the code in here does, but what's in here works just as well.

Note: only some of this code is production tested. It's relatively new, and I'm using it to build a couple of websites.

Disclaimer: Use if you want to. I don't expect you to. This is here primarily for my benefit, but if you find a use for it to, then go for it. I'd like to know who does actually find uses for it, drop me a link if you want.
